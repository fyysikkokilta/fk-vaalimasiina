# Conventional Commits

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for every commit message.

## Format

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

- **type** (required): `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.
- **scope** (optional): area of the codebase, e.g. `i18n`, `admin`, `vote`
- **description** (required): short, imperative, lowercase start (no period)

## Examples

```text
feat: add admin results view by candidate
feat(i18n): migrate translation JSON to TypeScript under src/i18n
fix: optional chaining for formErrors in ElectionForm
chore: update deps
docs: update README deployment section
```

## When suggesting commits

- Prefer **one logical change per commit**; use multiple commits when changes are unrelated.
- Use **imperative** in the subject: "add feature" not "added feature".
- Keep the **subject line under ~72 characters**; add a body only when needed.
