# Run Lint After Code Edits

After making code changes, **always run the project linter** to catch issues before finishing.

- Run `pnpm run lint` (or `pnpm lint --fix` if autofix is needed) and `pnpm format` after editing source files.
- If lint reports errors, fix them in the same session before considering the task done.
- Prefer running lint on the files or directories you changed rather than the whole project only when the change set is small and you want a quick check; otherwise run full lint.
